### Background to the Sample Size Calculator

This calculator is intended to help design surveys to estimate Herd Level Prevalence when the individual test is imperfect (1).

* The 1^st stage is to try different herd-level sensitivity and specificity values. These determine the number of animals to test to achieve the desired test performance and the calculator will find these.
* The 2^nd stage, given a particular herd-level sensitivity and specificity, and given your desired confidence and tolerance around the herd-level prevalence, is to calculate the necessary number of herds. The calculator will do this for you.

You may realise that there is no “single answer” because there is usually a trade-off between the number of animals to test and the number of herds.

We hope the value of the calculator is to allow the user to “experiment” with different values in order to focus in on their own preferred design whilst recognising the impact of those values on the predicted performance of the survey.

### Using the Calculator

The calculator is controlled using the inputs on the left-hand side of the __Graphical Output__ page. The following parameters can be adjusted

* Test Sensitivity
* Test Specificity
* Herd Specificity
* Confidence of Result
* Within Herd Prevalence of the Disease
* Herd Size

The results are expressed as the number of animals needing tested plotted against the number of herds. A range of values for tolerance and herd sensitivity are given. For more information, hover over the individual points.
